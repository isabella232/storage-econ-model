***cadCAD*** is a Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems through simulation, with support for Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping. 

# Getting Started
## 1. Installation: 
Requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

** Install Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/cadCAD/)** 
```bash
pip3 install cadCAD
```

 
## 2. Learn the basics
**Tutorials:** available both as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/tree/master/tutorials) 
and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEiYHRWA9g&list=PLmWm8ksQq4YKtdRV-SoinhV6LbQMgX1we) 

Familiarize yourself with some system modelling concepts and cadCAD terminology.

## 3. Documentation:
* [System Model Configuration](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/tree/master/documentation)
* [System Simulation Execution](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/blob/master/documentation/Simulation_Execution.md)
* [Policy Aggregation](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/blob/master/documentation/Policy_Aggregation.md)
* [System Model Parameter Sweep](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/blob/master/documentation/System_Model_Parameter_Sweep.md)

## 4. Connect
Find other cadCAD users at our [Discourse](https://community.cadcad.org/). We are a small but rapidly growing community.
